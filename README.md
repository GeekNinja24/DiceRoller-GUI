# DiceRoller-GUI
A Gui based dice roller based on python using Tkinter library for playing board games.

Libraries/Modules involved and their use:
1) Tkinter :
   Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI   applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
   
2)PIL:
  PIL is the Python Imaging Library which adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.

  This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

  The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.
  
3) Random:
   Python has a built-in module that you can use to make random numbers.Random module helps in choosing random image(face) of a  dice.
